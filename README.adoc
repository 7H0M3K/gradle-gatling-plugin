image:http://gatling.io/images/gatling-logo.png[Gatling Logo]

== Installation

Add following to `build.gradle`

[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
  id "com.github.lkishalmi.gatling" version "0.1.2"
}
----

== Project Layout

Plugin supports two source files layouts for `Gatling` simulations and related data.

* Standard Gradle/Maven layout
* Gatling-like layout

There's no need to explicitely setup one of those.
Plugin auto-detects used layout by checking folder structure.

=== Standard Gradle/Maven layout

|===
|Directory                      |   Meaning
|`src/gatling/scala`            |   Gatling simulation sources
|`src/gatling/resources/data`   |   Simulation data
|`src/gatling/resources/bodies` |   Request bodies
|===

=== Gatling-like layout

|===
|Directory                  |   Meaning
|`src/gatling/simulations`  |   Gatling simulation sources
|`src/gatling/data`         |   Simulation data
|`src/gatling/bodies`       |   Request bodies
|===


== Tasks

|===
|Task Name                          | Description
|`gatling`                          | Starts the default Gatling simulation(s)
|`gatlingClasses`                   | Compiles the Gatling simulation scripts
|`gatling-*${SimulationFQN}*` <1>   | Starts the named Gatling simulation
|===
<1> *${SimulationFQN}* should be replaced to fully qualified name of simulation class to be run.

== Plugin configuration

The used Gatling version can be configured in the project's Gatling Extension:

[source,groovy]
----
gatling.toolVersion = '2.1.7'
----

== Dependency Management

This plugin defines a `gatling` configuration which by default contains the whole `Gatling` runtime.
Required dependencies shall be added to this configuration. It would be used both for compile and
execution of Gatling Simulations.
